# COMP4329 Assignment 2

This repository explores ways to perform multi-modal multi-label classification with data imbalance.
Each repository provides instructions on how to run the model.

- Model Architecture 1: SqueezeNet
  - This model architecture can be found in `squeezenet` folder.

- Model Architecture 1: ResNet50 + BERT

  - This model architecture can be found in `resnet_bert_model` folder.

- Model Architecture 2: RegNetX 16GF + LSTM
  - This model architecture can be found in `regnet_lstm_model` folder.
  - Inside this folder contains the codes that run RegNetX 16GF & LSTM models.

Current Model: RegNetX 16GF + LSTM
