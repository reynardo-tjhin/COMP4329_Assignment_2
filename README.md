# COMP4329 Assignment 2

This repository explores ways to perform multi-modal multi-label classification with data imbalance.

## Model Architecture 1: ResNet50 + LSTM

## Model Architecture 2: RegNetX 16GF + LSTM

This model architecture can be found in `regnet_lstm_model` folder.
Inside this folder contains the codes that run RegNetX 16GF & LSTM models.

## Best Model: ...
