# Model Architecture: SqueezeNet

## Running this repository
This repository explores using SqueezeNet and GoogleNet to perform the classification tasks. The notebook also explores using LSTM but due to interest of time, we focus more on the SqueezeNet model. The notebook also tries to explore the CLIP model which was explored in this literature [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020). The notebook also explores Vision Transformer. To run the model, simply run the cells until the cell before "NLP with LSTM".
