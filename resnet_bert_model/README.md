# Model Architecture: ResNet + BERT

## Running this repository
This repository explores the final combined model architecture of ResNet50 and BERT model. **To run the repository, please go to the notebook and run all the cells.** Please be aware that depending on your hardware configuration, the time taken to finish running all the cells may be long. This also depends on the number of epochs used to train the model.

## Classification Tasks
The image classification task is first explored with our Custom CNN model, ResNet 50 model and AlexNet model. Finally, in the combined model, the ResNet 50 model is used instead. On the other hand, the text classification task is performed by using the BERT model.
